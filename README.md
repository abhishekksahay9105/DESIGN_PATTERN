# SOLID Principle for Opps

```
S-Single Responsibility Principle
O-Open/Close Principle
L-Liskov Substitution Principle
I-Interface Segmented Principle
D-Dependency Inversion Principle
```
### Advantage of SOLID Principle
```
1. Avoid Dupulicate code
2. Easy to Maintain
3. Easy to Understand
4. Flexible Software
5. Reduce Complexity
```

### Definition
```
S : A class or function should have only one reason to change.

O : Open for Extension but closed for Modification. Don't make change in already tested code. Extend the class for extra capability.

L : If class B is subclass of class A, then we should be able to replace object of A with B without breaking the behaviour of the program. 
    SubClass should extend the capability of parent class not narrow it down.

I : Interface should be such that client should not implement unnecessary function they do not need.

D : class should depends on interface rather than concreate class (Facade). Koi bhi member variable banao to wo interface type ka banao
```

# Design Pattern

```
1. Creational Design Pattern
    - Factory
    - Abstract Factory
    - Builder
    - Prototype
    - Singleton

2. Structural Design Pattern
    - Adaptor
    - Bridge
    - Composite
    - Decorator
    - Facade
    - Proxy
    - Flyweight

3. Behavioral Design Pattern
    - Chain of Responsibility
    - Command
    - Iterator
    - Mediator
    - Memento
    - State
    - Strategy
    - Template
    - Visitor
    - Null Object
    - Observer
