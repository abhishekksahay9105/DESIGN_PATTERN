1. What Are Behavioral Design Patterns?
    Behavioral patterns focus on how objects communicate and interact with each other.

    They help define:
        How responsibilities are distributed
        How objects collaborate
        The flow of information between objects
        Flexibility in communication while reducing coupling

        They deal with object behavior, not object creation or structure.

2. Purpose of Behavioral Patterns
    Behavioral patterns aim to answer:
        “How do objects talk to each other?”
        “How do we design communication while avoiding tight coupling?”
        “How do we write extendable and clean behavior logic?”

    Creational patterns → how objects are created
    Structural patterns → how objects are organized
